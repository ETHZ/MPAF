* write skims into a directory with class name, workdir/skims/classname/...root
* bugfix display yrange normalized (to unity) plots
* bugfix dataset names with "fake" (should not be stripped off in display, but stripped off in analysis, see tools/src/Dataset.cc)
* display correction scripts for datacards (see below)
* move python scripts (FRmacro, FRcomp, FRweight) to display 
* tidy up all analyzers and move general functions to MPAF, Tools or KineUtils

corrections on display datacards
* signals have negative process id
* dsname has no spaces, also in systemtics
* formatting, any of the 4 things can have largest size, not just dsname
* also systematics of MC_dummy
