# Simple counting experiment, with one signal and a few background processes 
# Simplified version of the 35/pb H->WW analysis for mH = 160 GeV
imax 1  number of channels
jmax *  number of backgrounds
kmax *  number of nuisance parameters (sources of systematical uncertainties)

# we have just one channel, in which we observe 0 events
bin 1
observation 0
------------
# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in that bin
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal
# then we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
# on each process and bin

lumi    lnN    1.11    -   1.11    -    lumi affects both signal and gg->WW (mc-driven). lnN = lognormal


xs_ggH  lnN    1.16    -     -     -    gg->H cross section + signal efficiency + other minor ones.
WW_norm gmN 4    -   0.16    -     -    WW estimate of 0.64 comes from sidebands: 4 events in sideband times 0.16 (=> ~50% statistical uncertainty)
xs_ggWW lnN      -     -   1.50    -    50% uncertainty on gg->WW cross section
bg_others lnN    -     -     -   1.30   30% uncertainty on the rest of the backgrounds
